#  ShopImpact: The Colorful Eco-Tracker

ShopImpact is a vibrant, interactive Python web app designed to make sustainable shopping fun. It combines **real-time data analytics** with **playful "Turtle" animations** to visualize the environmental cost of your purchases.

## Key Features
* **Colorful & Interactive:** A bright, nature-inspired UI (Mint, Ocean Blue, Sun Yellow).
* **Animated Turtle Graphics:** Watch a virtual turtle draw a "Leaf" (good choice) or "Footprint" (high impact) in real-time.
* ** Live Dashboard:** Instant updates on spending and Carbon Footprint.
* ** Badges & Gamification:** Earn "Eco Warrior" status by making green choices.
* ** Smart Suggestions:** Get alerts and greener brand alternatives for high-impact items.

##  "Turtle" Graphics Logic
Because standard Python `turtle` crashes in web browsers, this app uses a custom **Matplotlib Animation Engine**.
* It calculates geometry for leaves and footprints.
* It uses `time.sleep()` and iterative plotting to simulate the "drawing" motion of a turtle stroke-by-stroke.
